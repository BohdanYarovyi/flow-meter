										<p class="about-text"><span class="about-flowmeter-keyword">Flowmeter</span> is a web resource that allows you to measure your own productivity, using self-reported indicators.</p>
										<p class="about-text">This resource allows you to enter information about completed tasks every day and measure them in percentage. After entering tasks and their efficiency, you can calculate the overall efficiency for the day. At any time, you can simulate graphs to display efficiency indicators in time space.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="about-idea">
										<h3 class="about-title">Idea</h3>
										<p class="about-text">The idea is that each user will have their own account, which will become their personal space for tracking productivity. Thanks to this approach, everyone will be able to independently manage their statistics, adjusting them to their own needs and goals. We strive to create a convenient tool where you will have full control over your data, from entering daily indicators to analyzing the results in a clear and visual form. For example, users will be able to mark completed tasks, evaluate their effectiveness in percentage and see how these indicators add up to the overall picture of productivity for the day, week or even month. This approach allows you not only to record progress, but also to receive motivation for further improvement, because all the tools for this will be in your hands.</p>

								<div class="about-goal">
										<h3 class="about-title">Goal</h3>
										<p class="about-text">The goal of the Flowmeter project is to develop a user-friendly and useful application that will help users effectively track their productivity without complicating the process itself. We strive to create a tool that is easy to use, yet functional, so that anyone can easily integrate it into their daily lives. Instead of getting bogged down in complex settings or endless features, our team focuses on keeping the process intuitive and bringing real benefits. We want Flowmeter to become your trusted assistant in achieving your goals, allowing you to focus on what matters most — your tasks and progress — rather than fighting the application itself.</p>
